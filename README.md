## Efficient Warm Restart Projected Gradient Descent (EWR-PGD)

We propose a new white box adversarial attack method named EWR-PGD which exceeds the state-of-the-art attacks performance. It is more efficient than the state-of-the-art [ODI-PGD](https://github.com/ermongroup/ODS) method.

**Code will be available soon.**

### Comparison of  EWR-PGD and ODI-PGD 
**When reducing the models to the same accuracy, the number of restarts required by the EWR-PGD significantly less than that of the ODI-PGD. EWR-PGD is up to roughly 5 times faster than ODI-PGD.**

Figure 1. On 10 state-of-the-art defense models, comparison of the number of restarts required(the lower the better) when the EWR-PGD and ODI-PGD methods reduce the models to the same accuracy.

The models are available online:

### Results on 3 White-box leaderboards

**EWR-PGD ranks first on the TRADES white-box MNIST and CIFAR-10 leaderboards, reducing the accuracy of their MNIST model to 92.52% and the accuracy of their CIFAR-10 model to 52.95%. EWR-PGD also ranks first on MardyLab’s White-box CIFAR-10 leaderboard, reducing the accuracy of their CIFAR-10 model to 43.96%.**
